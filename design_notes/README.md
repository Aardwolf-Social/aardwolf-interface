These are the UI designs that Banjo has been trying to come up with.  Feel free to comment, suggest changes.

/pencil_files -- This is where the project file for [Evolus Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) wireframing application lives<br />
/scanned_drawing -- Scanned original copies of the design that Banjo tattooed onto dead trees (pencil/pen, and paper)<br />
/wireframes -- These are the exported PNG wireframes from Pencil.<br />
/img -- Static images for the interface can go here.
